# {{ page.title }}

Aside from my on CorrienteLatina.com website, I do some really cool coding for the **WuTang Clan**. I have built some of the web "games" that many people have played on the web.

### [WuTang Name Generator](http://wutangclan.net/name-generator/){:target="_blank"}

This web app is the famous Wutang Name generator. Not the one used by Childish Gambino, but the official version on the Wutang Clan's official website.

### [Wu Quiz](http://wutangclan.net/quiz/){:target="_blank"}

We thought it would be a cool idea to see what the Wutang fans really knew about the Wutang Clan. So we set out to build a quiz that has been used by thousands of people. Only a few have answered all the questions correctly.

### [Wu Wisdom](http://wutangclan.net/wu-wisdom/){:target="_blank"}

The Wu has always been about positivity in their music and away from it. So this page on the website will give you new wu-wisdom everytime the page is loaded.

### Wu-???

Yes. I just finished building a brand new game for the Wutang Clan fans. What it is? Well, I can't say yet, but it will be a pretty fun game!
