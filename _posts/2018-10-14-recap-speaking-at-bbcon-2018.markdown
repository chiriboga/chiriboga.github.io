If you read my post about [heading to BBCon to speak](/blog/2018/06/speaking-at-bbcon-2018/ "heading to BBCon to speak"), you know that this was a goal of mine since 2017 when I went to my first BBCon. It became a reality and in a session called "Strategies from the Best Blackbaud TeamRaiser that Never Launched." Alongside Kari, and Mark from [Cathexis Partners](http://cathexispartners.com "Cathexis Partners"). 

## My Segment From The Session

Not sure if you guys could tell, but I was pretty nervous. All the notes I had written down when out the window and I decided to talk a bit more around the slides. I wanted to focus on [digestible content](/blog/2018/09/digestible-content/ "digestible content") and the great use I made from WordPress. 

## The Rest of BBCon

During the two days I was in Orlando for BBCon, I was able to catch a few great sessions and learned quite a few things that I could add to my personal knowledge base. But what good is a recap without pitcutes right?
