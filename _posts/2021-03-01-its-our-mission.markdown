One of the pet projects I have been working on is this concept of [It's Our Mission](https://www.itsourmission.org){:target="_blank"}. My vision is to have a website that is a valuable destination for DIY How-To content for nonprofits in the realm of Creative, Data, Marketing, and Web.

I launched it in early February and really enjoyed building it out. It uses Graph CMS, Gatsby and is currently hosted on Netify. 

I am currently looking for anyone interested in adding content to the website. So please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested.
