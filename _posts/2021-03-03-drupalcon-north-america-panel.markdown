Working for a great company like <a href="https://www.smiletrain.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smile Train</a> has allowed me to grow as a project manager and has added so much value to my voice across the web ethos. We recently relaunched our website and partnered up with FFW Agency to produce what I would consider one of the best web designs in the nonprofit space out right now. Over a few months, we all worked hard to discuss and come up with a final design, functionality, technology, analytics, goals; both short and long term, as well as user experience and workflows. 

Our teams ran like a seamless machine with each member bringing such great talent and dedication. So it was only right that we continued to work on future projects.  FFW has recently <a href="https://ffwagency.com/work/smile-train" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showcased our work</a> together and even worked together to speak at <a href="https://events.drupal.org/drupalcon2021/summit/nonprofit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drupal Con 2021 Non Profit Summit</a>.
