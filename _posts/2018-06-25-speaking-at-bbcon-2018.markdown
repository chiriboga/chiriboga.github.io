While working at the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade in 2017, I was asked to attend BBCon and catch sessions to help see what other nonprofits were doing and see what we could use to help our own nonprofit. I learned from some great people and sessions and got to meet Noah Cooper; a principle Web Developer at Blackbaud. He had some great sessions and at that point I made it a goal to be able to talk at one of the sessions in 2018. I thought that dream was over since the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade is no more. 

I have been doing some really small work for [Cathexis Partners](http://cathexispartners.com "Cathexis Partners"){:target="_blank"}; A firm with over 10 years experience in helping nonprofits use technology to raise funds and engage supporters more effectively.Not to mention that they have over 750 clients under their belt. I say that to say that they have also been involved in BBCon for quite a number of years and are actually sponsors for the annual event. I spoke to Mark Becker, one of the owners a few months ago about trying to develop a session about the "redesign that never was" as Mark put it. Fast forward a couple of months and I get the email that the session had been approved. 

So I am off to BBCon in October to take in some great sessions as well as speak in our very own session on the Redesign that never was!
