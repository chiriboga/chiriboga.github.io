## What is Jekyll

This is probably the first question you should be asking yourself if you have never heard of it. To put it in super simple terms, Jekyll is a static website generator. Think about it as a system that allows you to create a blog enabled website without needing a database to house the data. For more of the official definition you can check out the [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)


### But why would you want to do it this way?

Well for me, it was a matter of not having the need for a database or some exact type of server to run my website. In fact, the site you are reading this on is a Jekyll website hosted on github itself. 

** What Do I need to know before jumping in? ***
+ Basic HTML Knowledge
+ Baisc Markdown knowledge
+ Basic Command Line Knowledge
+ Follow Directions

For me, the biggest thing was setting up the environment for running Jekyll. I recently tried to walk someone through getting their computer ready to install and run Jekyll
