## What is Jekyll
This is probably the first question you should be asking yourself if you have never heard of it. To put it in super simple terms, Jekyll is a static website generator. Think about it as a system that allows you to create a blog enabled website without needing a database to house the data. For more of the official definition you can check out the [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)


### But why would you want to do it this way?
Well for me, it was a matter of not having the need for a database or some exact type of server to run my website. In fact, the site you are reading this on is a Jekyll website hosted on github itself. 


### What Do I need to know before jumping in?
+ Basic HTML Knowledge
+ Baisc Markdown knowledge
+ Basic Command Line Knowledge
+ Follow Directions

For me, the biggest thing was setting up the environment for running Jekyll. I recently tried to walk someone through getting their computer ready to install and run Jekyll and it took a little bit to install homebrew, install ruby and an actually usable version.


### Benefits of using Jekyll for your website
+ No database, nothing that a bad person can use to try to hack into your website. 
+ You can put it on any server.Which allows for less expensive hosting.
+ Easy to change using Jekyll; even main navigation items.
+ Easy to push to your server

### Disadvantages of using Jekyll for your website
+ Have to wait for the site to generate. Granted it could take a minute or two. 
+ Some say limited functionality, but with API's and such, this is becoming less and less.
