Have you ever tried to find information about something, went to a website and all of a sudden you come across a page, scroll down and pow! "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times". You sigh at the mere idea of thinking how long it will take you to read and try to understand the massive amounts of data that are on the page. 

Well **Digestible Content** is a way to try to shift the perspective of the way we show data and how the user consumes it. 


I like to think of it as some sort of Cliff Notes for the modern era. Think about it.  We are all now accustomed to 140 characters that twitter had. I bet some of you are still tweeting short concise messages even though you have way more freedom to type more. Am I right?


## Thought Process
* Break up long content into short bursts of sentences or bullet points. This will allow you to think about what is the most important content you want the reader to know. 
* See that Header above, you can totally use it to break up content into categories for more yummy digestion. 
* Sometimes an images is worth 1000 words or so they say. If you are talking about a cabin in the woods surrounded by beauty, blah blah, show a picture of it. "As shown above ..."


## But We Need to go Deep Into the Content
Do you? Think about the directions you get when you buy some furniture you need to build. It shows you all the pieces and tells you exactly what you need to do in order to build it. 

There's no fluff, they dont tell you where the wood is from or what kind of iron the nails are made from. Stick to your points. If I wanted to know where the wood came from, I would do further research myself. 



## So We Should All Write Twitter Style?
No. I am not saying that we should all just abondon presenting deep dive content. I am just suggesting that there's a time and place for everything. 

If you are trying to sell clothes and you go to myfavoriteclothes.com and are looking at shirts, the descriptions are short and precise.  They give you the exact information you will need to help you make the choice. 


So to reiterate, break up the content into clear facts, structure your data and use choice words. 

If you need some help with figuring this out, shoot me a note below.
