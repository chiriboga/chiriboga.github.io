I recently spoke during the Virtual Drupal NYC Meetup March 3rd, 2021 alongside some other great presenters. I think the content supplied was well versed and would be an asset to digest.

## Avoiding agency nightmares when relaunching your website by Richard Chiriboga

## 10 minute Drupal web performance makeover by David Jeyachandran
We'll take a Drupal site and try and make it one of the fastest websites on the Internet - thanks to a few Drupal modules. We will use WebPageTest and Google's Lighthouse score to benchmark our frontend performance and then identify how we can make the site faster. Improving performance can be complicated and time-consuming but with the stopwatch running we'll see what difference we can make in just 10 minutes. At the end of this talk, you'll know how to identify potential performance improvements for your site and which modules to install. Using benchmarking you'll be able to demonstrate the before and after results of your changes.
