I have to admit that I have recently been fascinated with trying to build some cool "game" using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. My first attempt; which is a still a work in progress was a jQuery [remake of "Dope Wars"](https://richardchiriboga.com/drugwars/){:target="_blank"}. Do you guys remember that game?

I think I wanted to see if I could and I think it came out pretty cool. Next I wanted to create something that I could reuse on my own [CorrienteLatina.com"](https://www.corrientelatina.com){:target="_blank"} website as well as the [WuTangClan.net"](http://www.WuTangClan.net){:target="_blank"} website. The one for the WuTang Will drop soon.

This is a scene from the game. You basically have 20 seconds to click on who you think rapped the lyrics. Let me know what you guys think in the comments.
