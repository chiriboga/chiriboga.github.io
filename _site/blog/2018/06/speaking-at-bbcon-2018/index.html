&lt;h1 id=&quot;headed-to-bbcon-to-speak-at-my-first-session&quot;&gt;Headed to BBCon to Speak at My First Session&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working at the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade in 2017, I was asked to attend BBCon and catch sessions to help see what other nonprofits were doing and see what we could use to help our own nonprofit. I learned from some great people and sessions and got to meet Noah Cooper; a principle Web Developer at Blackbaud. He had some great sessions and at that point I made it a goal to be able to talk at one of the sessions in 2018. I thought that dream was over since the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been doing some really small work for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cathexispartners.com&quot; title=&quot;Cathexis Partners&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cathexis Partners&lt;/a&gt;; A firm with over 10 years experience in helping nonprofits use technology to raise funds and engage supporters more effectively.Not to mention that they have over 750 clients under their belt. I say that to say that they have also been involved in BBCon for quite a number of years and are actually sponsors for the annual event. I spoke to Mark Becker, one of the owners a few months ago about trying to develop a session about the “redesign that never was” as Mark put it. Fast forward a couple of months and I get the email that the session had been approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am off to BBCon in October to take in some great sessions as well as speak in our very own session: “Strategies from the Best Blackbaud TeamRaiser that Never Launched”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/chiriboga-speaking-bbcon-2018.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive center-block featured-blog-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can still learn valuable tips from campaigns that never launched! Avon 39® had a stellar Blackbaud TeamRaiser plan for the 2018 Walk to End Breast Cancer®, but when the event was replaced with another program, the plan was no longer needed. This session reviews strategies from the organization’s plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
